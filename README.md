# weatherApp


The Weather App is a Flutter application that provides real-time weather information for various locations around the world. It utilizes the Weather API to fetch weather data, the Geolocator plugin to determine the user's current location, and the BLoC pattern for state management.

# Features
The Weather App offers the following features:

Current Location: The app automatically detects the user's current location using the Geolocator plugin and displays the weather information for that location.

Search by City: Users can enter the name of a specific city in the search field to fetch the weather data for that particular location.

Refresh Button: The app includes a refresh button that allows users to manually update the weather information. When pressed, it fetches the latest weather data for the current location or the last searched city.

Offline Mode: If the user's device is not connected to the internet, the app displays a toast message indicating the lack of internet connectivity. Users are alerted to check their internet connection and try again.

Location Not Found: If the entered city name is not found in the Weather API, the app shows a toast message informing the user that the location could not be found. Users can double-check the spelling or try searching for a different city.
